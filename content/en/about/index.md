I'm a software programmer and architect by profession, promoting free and open source software (FOSS)
based solutions to businesses. Traveling, World Culture, Traditions, Literature and Music interests me.
I speak primarily in _Kannada_, a beautiful language of South Indian state of Karnataka and one of the
classical languages of India.

_Thanks for visiting_.
