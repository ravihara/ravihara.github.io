Here is a link to the BASH script to configure apt repository for [Podman](https://gist.github.com/ravihara/1a612a6f054e2878de8a9905824891da). The script is available as a GitHub Gist. Hence, you are requested to open the above link and download the script (or, copy-paste into a file using a text-editor) to use it directly from your Debian-based system such as _Debian_, _Ubuntu_ or _LinuxMint_ (including _LMDE_).

## Prerequisites

The script should be run using an administrator or, superuser account (i.e., with `sudo` access). The script requires `wget` to be available in the system.
