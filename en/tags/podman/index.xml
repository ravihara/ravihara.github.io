Earthly will look for docker eventhough it doesn&amp;rsquo;t depend on it explicitly. For those who prefer podman as an alternate to using docker the following guide will help in setting up Earthly to use podman instead of docker.</description></item><item><title>Podman for Debian based systems</title><link>https://www.ravihara.in/en/posts/setup-apt-podman/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 08:30:24 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.ravihara.in/en/posts/setup-apt-podman/</guid><description>Here is a link to the bash-script to configure apt repository for Podman . The script is available as a GitHub Gist. Hence, you are requested to open the link to the bash-script and download the script (or, copy-paste the raw content into a file using a text-editor) to use it directly from your Debian-based system such as Debian, Ubuntu or LinuxMint (including LMDE).
The script will setup the proper apt repository configuration file under /etc/apt/sources.</description></item></channel></rss>
