Earthly will look for docker eventhough it doesn&amp;rsquo;t depend on it explicitly. For those who prefer podman as an alternate to using docker the following guide will help in setting up Earthly to use podman instead of docker.</description></item><item><title>Earthly for Debian based systems</title><link>https://www.ravihara.in/en/posts/setup-apt-earthly/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 08:30:24 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.ravihara.in/en/posts/setup-apt-earthly/</guid><description>Here is a link to the bash-script to configure apt repository for Earthly .

The script works on both private and public repositories. If using a private repo, you need to export an environment variable named GITHUB_PAT with the value of your github personal access token. This script depends mainly on the git tags. If you use a custom prefix for your git tags, you need to provide it as an option.</description></item><item><title>Using abstract class and interface in Java</title><link>https://www.ravihara.in/en/posts/java-class-vs-iface/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 11:55:24 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.ravihara.in/en/posts/java-class-vs-iface/</guid><description>This post captures various best-practices and/or useful suggestions which might come handy while programming in Java.
